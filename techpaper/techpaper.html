				<p>With Rackspace’s new OnMetal cloud servers you can combine the ease of spinning up a multi-tenant cloud server with the performance of a single-tenant traditional bare-metal server.  
					The server’s hardware design is a tweaked version of the Open Compute Project.  
					The servers also come with three setups.</p>
				<p>The first setup that is offered is the OnMetal Compute. 
					Which runs on 10 Intel Xeon E5-2680 V2 2.8 Ghz processors and 32 GB of RAM.  
					The pricing for this setup is about $500 a month with just the base infrastructure.  
					The Compute setup is geared towards being used with basic web and application servers, queue processing, and load balancers as stated by Rackspace.</p>
				<p>The next setup is OnMetal Memory. 
					This runs on 12 Intel Xeon E5-2630 v2 2.6 Ghz processors and 512 GB of RAM.  
					This setup runs roughly $1600 a month and is geared towards caching, search indexes, and in-memory analytics.</p>
				<p>The final setup is OnMetal I/O.  
					This setup runs on 20 Intel Xeon E5-2680 v2 2.8 Ghz processors, 2 LSI Nytro WarpDrive BLP4-1600 (1.6TB), and 128 GB of Ram.  
					This setup costs the most at a rough estimate of $1750.  
					Rackspace lists the anticipated workload as Online transaction processing, NoSQL databases, and Traditional SQL databases.</p>
				<p>All three setups have a 32GB SATADOM Boot device and a 10Gbps network connection.</p>
				<p>With the OnMetal cloud servers being single-tenant this allows for running of many higher end services without taxing resources as a multi-tenant environment would.  
					The servers also allow for more performance that is not affected by having to include additional software to deal with servers having multiple tenants.  
					Rackspace’s OnMetal cloud servers are going places and only the future may tell where they lead.</p>
